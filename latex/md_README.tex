\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{Dependencies}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
To get started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item GCC ($>$= 9.\+4)
\item Python3 ($>$= 3.\+8)
\item Make ($>$= 4.\+2)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Please note that you will need to install Valgrind manually if you haven\textquotesingle{}t already.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{Building the Library}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
Simply run {\ttfamily make} in your terminal.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{Testing}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
After building the library, you can run comprehensive tests to ensure everything is working as expected. Follow these steps\+:

Navigate to the test directory and run {\ttfamily test\+\_\+all.\+py}. Run following commands\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd test}
\DoxyCodeLine{python test\_all.py}

\end{DoxyCode}


This will execute tests covering all arithmetic operations.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysection{How to Use}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}
